#+TITLE: How Bitcoin Transactions Work

This guide aims to serve as a concise entry point for a technical dive
into bitcoin. It is not trying to be a complete overview on its own;
see below for sources. As with any software, the ultimate source of
truth for technical details is the source code.

Transactions are a great place to start when trying to understand
bitcoin. Each block in the bitcoin ledger is fundamentally a list of
transactions[fn:1], and understanding transactions is prerequisite to
understanding bitcoin "addresses".

* Transactions
From a high level, a single bitcoin transaction consists of a list of
inputs and a list of outputs[fn:2].

Each output contains, crucially, two things:
- An amount. We call the unit for this amount the "satoshi"; we call
  100 million satoshis a bitcoin.
- A "locking script", also widely referred to as ~scriptPubKey~ (a
  name which comes from the bitcoin source[fn:3]). This script
  imposes rules on how this output can be spent by a future
  transaction.

Each input contains, similarly, two things:
- An hash of an existing transaction, and an index referring to one of
  its unused outputs. Once used, the unspent transaction output
  (widely referred to as "UTXO") cannot be used again. (The reason for
  this is that it makes the structure of the ledger very simple: an
  "account" on this ledger doesn't carry a balance, but instead is
  static until closed)
- A "unlocking script" (also widely called ~scriptSig~). Part of
  verifying a transaction is concatenating the unlocking script of an
  input with the locking script of the referenced output and
  evaluating the result using bitcoin script[fn:4].

An implication of this structure is that there can be different types
of "addresses", corresponding to different types of locking scripts,
and that those "addresses" are interoperable: when a UTXO locked using
one type of script is spent, the spender can choose any type of script
to lock it again[fn:5].

The locking and unlocking scripts are written in a Turing-incomplete
DSL referred to as "bitcoin script". Technically any arbitrary script
can be provided as a locking script[fn:6], but the reference bitcoin
client only accepts 5 "standard" transaction script
patterns[fn:7]. The expected way to lock transaction output is to
require a signature from the recipient, and so there are [[https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script#Opcodes][opcodes]] builtin
to bitcoin script that support signing and verifying signatures using
a specific public-key cryptosystem (ECDSA with ~secp256k1~--see
below). But, AFAIK, you could implement any public key signature
system as a (very long) bitcoin script.

* Signatures
Bitcoin needs a mechanism for signing a transactions so that only the
intended recipient has the ability to spend a specific output of a
specific transaction. For this it uses the elliptic curve digital
signature algorithm (ECDSA). The ECDSA is a variant of the
NIST-standardized DSA algorithm and can be used with an elliptic curve
of any parameters. For its elliptic curve, bitcoin uses [[https://www.secg.org/sec2-v2.pdf][~secp256k1~]]
which is a specific elliptic curve published by the Standards for
Efficient Cryptography Group (SECG).

** How does ECDSA work?
The digital signature algorithm uses a public key to serve as a public
identity, and a corresponding private key to sign a message.

The first step in generating a key pair is generating a private
key. For the ECDSA that bitcoin uses, the valid values of this key are
from ~0x1~ to ~0xFFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF BAAE DCE6
AF48 A03B BFD2 5E8C D036 4140~[fn:8]. This number is less than
$2^{256}$, but so very slightly that we might as well call them
equivalent. In fact, these two numbers differ by more than the number
of grains of sand on ten quadrillion Earths[fn:9], but $2^{256}$ is so
large that this difference is hard to notice.

Once the private key is chosen, the public key is determined as
$K = k * G$ where:
- $K$ is the public key
- $k$ is the private key
- $G$ is the generator point, specified by ~secp256k1~
- $*$ is elliptic curve multiplication

For further details on ECDSA, including signature computation, try:
https://cryptobook.nakov.com/digital-signatures/ecdsa-sign-verify-messages

** Why ECDSA?
Cryptographic signing generally (but [[https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/14654/digital-signature-using-symmetric-key-cryptography][not always]]) requires an
asymmetric cryptosystem. Other asymmetric cryptosystems exist: RSA
(which is slower) and Diffie-Hellman (which is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffieâ€“Hellman_key_exchange#Public_key][not usually used for
signatures]]) and even vanilla DSA (which would require storing larger
keys for the same level of security, resulting in a bigger
ledger).

** Why ~secp256k1~?
For reasons discussed [[https://dappworks.com/why-did-satoshi-decide-to-use-secp256k1-instead-of-secp256r1/][here]].

* Locking Patterns
A bitcoin "address" is a piece of information that you can give to
someone else to put in their transcation output locking script; this
information is different based on which locking pattern you
choose. The term "address" can be misleading because a bitcoin
"address" is intended to be a single-use invoice (to use the
terminology of the bitcoin wiki[fn:10]) rather than a persistent,
pseudonymous address.

Because there are different types of locking scripts, your payer needs
to know what kind of information you're giving them to construct the
correct kind of locking script. For this reason, there are standard
prefixes[fn:11] corresponding to different locking patterns. These
prefixes are only used by the piece of software you use to make
transactions (the "wallet") and don't actually appear in the
blockchain[fn:12].

An implication of the locking mechanism is that destroying bitcoins is
straightforward:
- https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Controlled_supply
- https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/1851/how-to-generate-a-valid-bitcoin-address-for-destroying-bitcoins/1852

For each of the following five standard locking patterns, the
following source is great for more detail:

https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/scriptPubKey

** Pay to Public Key ("P2PK")
Overview: the unlocking script verifies that the spender's signature
matches the public key provided by the payer.

There are problems with this pattern:
1. Public keys are long (65 bytes)[fn:13] and therefore hard to share
2. The payee must reveal their public key before spending, which poses
   theoretical security risks[fn:14] (such as that posed by a
   hypothetical version of Shor's algorithm modified to solve the
   discrete log problem on elliptic curves); but, in a quantum
   context, bitcoin would have bigger problems[fn:15]

This pattern is not in modern use.

** Pay to Public Key Hash ("P2PKH")
Overview: the locking script verifies that the spender's (ECDSA) public
key maps to a hash specified by the payer, and that the spender can
provide a signature to match their public key.

Specifically, the locking script computes a ~RIPEMD160(SHA256())~ hash
of the public key. ~RIPEMD160(SHA256())~ maps a 256-bit public key to
a 160-bit hash. There are at most $2^{160}$ P2PKH addresses (it's
"suspected", but not certain[fn:16], that RIPEMD160 actually reaches
all 2^{160} values) and there are almost $2^{256}$ private keys;
therefore, there are on average about $2^{96}$ private keys that collide
to each of the about $2^{160}$ P2PKH addresses.

P2PKH addresses are shared by encoding the hash using Base58Check
which makes the address:
- shorter, because a public key hash is used instead of a full public
  key
- more readable, because Base58Check excludes ambiguous characters
- less error-proton, because Base58Check incorporates a checksuum

It is the job of the wallet[fn:17] to strip the prefix and checksum
from an entered P2PKH address so that the raw public key hash can be
used in the locking script and correctly checked for equality.

There are a couple of good sources that breakdown a real P2PKH
transaction:
- https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/57644/what-are-the-parts-of-a-bitcoin-transaction-input-script
- https://medium.com/coinmonks/bitcoin-p2pkh-transaction-breakdown-bb663034d6df

Many say that if compressed public keys had been known to the
architect of bitcoin, P2PKH would not have been necessary[fn:18]
(because ~RIPEMD160(SHA256())~ mainly serves to shorten the key, not
to add security). Still, the Base58Check encoding is valuable.

** Multisig ("P2MS", BIP 11)
Overview: the unlocking script verifies that enough signatures
matching the public keys provided by the payer are given by the
spender. Perhaps a better name for this type of transaction would be
P2PKs.

** Pay to Script Hash ("P2SH", BIP 16)
Overview: the locking script verifies that the spender's unlocking script
maps to the hash specified by the payer; then the unlocking script is
deserialized (reinterpreted not as a value to be hashed but as a
sequence of opcodes to be executed) and executed (using arguments
provided by the spender) to confirm validity. Since this transaction
type involves more than just concatenating the unlocking and locking
scripts and then executing (it needs to execute the unlocking script
too), it required an amendment to bitcoin: [[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0016.mediawiki#Backwards_Compatibility][BIP 16]].

Note that providing and using those inputs is necessary to achieve
security. Imagine a script the pushes a magic number on the stack,
duplicates it, and checks for equality. This script doesn't use inputs
and always succeeds. If you use the hash of this script to receive
funds, then as soon as you broadcast a transaction that spends your
coins, anyone watching could use your script to broadcast a different
transaction spending the output in a different way.

It is cheaper to use P2SH to implement multisig than it is to use the
P2MS pattern.

** Data Output
Overview: the locking script just stores data.

Example transaction:
[[https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/transaction/52dd20f60d6e14e5a783e7668cf410efdea40cd9a92479b0f2423d0bc63575fa][~52dd20f60d6e14e5a783e7668cf410efdea40cd9a92479b0f2423d0bc63575fa~]]

* "Segregated Witness"
"Segregated witness" or "segwit" refers to the segregation of witness
data (the ~scriptSig~ of each transaction input) from the transaction
itself. In 2015, [[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki][BIP141]] proposed this change and [[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0173.mediawiki][BIP173]] proposed a new
address type for native segregates witness output. People refer to
P2PKH and P2SH segwit transactions as P2WPKH and P2WSH repectively,
but the logic of the locking is the same[fn:19]
- https://learnmeabitcoin.com/faq/segregated-witness
- https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/75047/bitcoin-technical-difference-between-p2pkh-and-p2sh-address-generation

* Using bitcoin: "addresses" and "wallets"
A wallet is a piece of hardware or software that interfaces with the
ledger (blockchain) and stores the keys that allow you (and only you)
to spend transaction output. "Wallet" is a misleading metaphor if:
- It evokes the existence of distinct tokens
- It can be understood as a single address on the blockchain that
  accumulates a balance over time

In fact, "addresses" aren't intended to be reused[fn:20], and
"addresses" (transaction outputs) don't have balances: they're either
spent or unspent. That being said, a wallet can be thought of as an
account, composed of many different addresses, that together have a
usable balance.

In order to make a bitcoin address, you don't actually need to access
the blockchain or the internet: you just need to understand how
locking scripts work. There are various tools that automate the
process of address generation without functioning as a complete
"wallet":
- [[https://www.bitaddress.org][www.bitaddress.org]] 
- [[https://github.com/samr7/vanitygen][vanitygen]], a command-line tool for generating vanity bitcoin
  addresses

And there are also many walkthroughs on manually generating a bitcoin
address yourself:
- https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/59644/how-do-these-openssl-commands-create-a-bitcoin-private-key-from-a-ecdsa-keypair
- https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/10827/generate-address-for-receiving-on-gnu-linux-without-bitcoin-client
- https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-generate-your-very-own-bitcoin-private-key-7ad0f4936e6c/
- https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/diy-bitcoin-private-key-project
- https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/7491/how-to-generate-keypair-completely-offline
- https://medium.com/coinmonks/how-to-generate-a-bitcoin-address-step-by-step-9d7fcbf1ad0b
- https://gist.github.com/colindean/5239812

Then there are of course many wallets, and many classifications of
wallets: hot, cold, paper, custodial, non-custodial, hardware,
software, ...

https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet

There are estimated to be 460 million bitcoin addresses as of
2018[fn:21].

How you choose to generate bitcoin address is up to you, but security
is important. If you choose a non-random private key, such as ~0x1~,
then the corresponding address will be publicly known. For private key
~0x1~, the corresponding address is
[[https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/1EHNa6Q4Jz2uvNExL497mE43ikXhwF6kZm][~1EHNa6Q4Jz2uvNExL497mE43ikXhwF6kZm~]]: you can see that any funds to this
account are quickly spent[fn:22].

A secure, somewhat accessible way (outlined [[https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/How_to_set_up_a_secure_offline_savings_wallet][here]]) to generate an
address/secret pair is do so on a bootable, verified linux USB drive
that you never connect to the internet. Specifically, I recommend
making a bootable copy of tails (something good to have around
anyways), which comes with the Electrum wallet by default. [[https://dev-notes.eu/2017/08/setup-and-manage-bitcoin-core-cold-storage-wallet/][This post]]
offers a good walkthrough of the process (tails itself has good
documentation on installing and verifying tails), but it uses verified
bitcoin-core binaries instead of tails' builtin Electrum app. The way
I recommend is to:
  1. [[https://tails.boum.org/install/index.en.html][Install tails]] on a USB
  2. Disable internet connection and boot tails
  3. Use Electrum to generate a new wallet
  4. Store your public/private key pair (however you want)

Once you make an address, how should you store the key? Well, this
question can be asked of any digital secret--I don't think there
should be a special answer for bitcoin. [[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki][BIP39]] standardized a mnemonic
code so that a private key can be stored as a sequence of words (in
English or other languages) instead of as a number (encoded in
decimal, binary, hex, base58, etc). This sequence of words is called a
seed and can be used to deterministically generate a tree of keypairs
(many addresses) according to [[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki][BIP32]]. A BIP39 seed has at least 128
bits of entropy (Electrum's has 132 bits of entropy [fn:23]) so that
it has enough entropy to generate a private key of 128 bits of
entropy. This seed can be easily written down and stored on paper.

* Nodes, the network, blockchain, etc.
I'm leaving these concepts out of scope for now. There are lots of
interesting topics beyond transactions such as:
- "Forking" the blockchain
- Proof-of-work
- Attacks
- "Mining"

For architectural considerations of bitcoin, I would recommend the
whitepaper: https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf

** Preventing Double-Spend
Bitcoin nodes maintain an [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30425272/how-do-bitcoin-miners-check-for-double-spend-or-over-spend][index of UTXOs]] (unspent transaction outputs)
alongside the blockchain. I haven't looked at the implementation, but
I imagine this to be a hash table mapping a transaction id ~+~ output
index to a locking script [fn:24]. Generating this index from an
existing blockchain would be straightforward. The chain would be
processes block-by-block, transaction-by-transaction: each valid
transaction output would be unconditionally added to the index (in
amortized O(1) time); each input would be checked against the index
(also O(1) time) and then removed (constant-time) if present
(otherwise the transaction would be rejected, or the block
unconfirmed).

about $10^{21}$ grains of sand on Earth ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(numbers)#1021][source]]), and so there are 10^{38}
grains of sand on ten quadrillion ($10^{16}$) Earths.
