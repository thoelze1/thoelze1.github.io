# My Personal Website

This is my source for [tannerhoelzel.com](http://www.tannerhoelzel.com). I started my site using only HTML; since then I have added CSS and JavaScript (I will probably add some C# too). Once I understand the basics, I might make use of a framework like Bootstrap. Until then, I'll be having fun messing with JS and C#.

Thanks for stopping by!

## To Do

- Improve purplish color generation (manipulating red, green, and blue separately doesn't always make a nice purple)
- Update favicon.ico according to random color
