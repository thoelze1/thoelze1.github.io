#+TITLE: Uploading Large Files to the Garmin inReach Explorer+

Garmin imposes a size limit on routes uploaded to the
=Explorer+=. Nowhere could I find a definitive presentation of what
can and can't be uploaded to the device, so for the purposes of this
post let's say that routes consisting of up to 200 points can be
uploaded.

There are many free tools that claim to split =.gpx= files into
smaller parts:
- [[https://sites.google.com/site/gpxtracksplitter/][gpxtracksplitter]] (Windows)
- [[http://iamdanfox.github.io/gpxsplitter/][gpxsplitter]] (Browser)
- Numerous repos on GitHub

I couldn't get any of these to work, but I found an [[https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/193168/how-to-split-a-gpx-track-file-into-several-files-of-n-trackpoints-each][SO post]] that
explained how to achieve my goal with [[http://gpsbabel.org][gpsbabel]]. The described script
worked well, but produced many files that needed to be uploaded
one-by-one to Garmin's online portal. I edited the script to recompose
the resulting files:

#+begin_src bash
  #!/bin/bash

  # $1 is input
  # $2 is output
  # $3 is (optionally) max number of points per file

  prefix="${1%.*}-"
  gpsbabel -i gpx -f "$1" -t -o csv -F - \
    | gsplit -d -l ${3:-200} --additional-suffix=.csv - "$prefix"

  echo -e "<?xml version=\"1.0\" ?>\n<gpx>\n</gpx>" > "$2"
  for f in "$prefix"*.csv; do
      gpsbabel -i csv -f "$f"                              \
               -i gpx -f "$2"                              \
               -x transform,trk=wpt -x nuketypes,waypoints \
               -o gpx -F "$2"
      rm "$f"
  done
#+end_src

The output file can be uploaded in one shot.
